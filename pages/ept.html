		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The Essential Performance Tool (EPT) is an advanced analytical and decision-support 
            platform designed to help engineers identify, evaluate, and verify the essential 
            performance functions of a medical device throughout its lifecycle. Built around 
            ISO, IEC, and FDA design control principles, the tool guides users through 
            structured risk assessments, performance requirement definition, reliability
            modeling, and verification planning. EPT enables teams to clearly distinguish 
            life-supporting or safety-critical functions from non-critical features, ensuring
            that the product will be protected under all intended use conditions. By integrating data,
            analytics, and structured engineering workflows, the Essential Performance Tool improves design
            robustness, accelerates compliance, supports regulatory readiness, and strengthens cross-functional
            communication, ultimately helping organizations achieve “first-time-right” product development.</p>
